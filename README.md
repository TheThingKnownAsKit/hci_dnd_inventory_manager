# hci_dnd_inventory_manager
Get set up by making sure you have a venv (pip hates you)
`pip install reflex`
make sure you have sourced the venv and are in the hci_dd_inventory_manager/ directory in your cmd line and do `reflex run`

Will need firestore eventually. It is a NoSQL database that also does user auth if we want login/logout
`pip install firebase-admin`
